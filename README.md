# non-invasive-blood-group-prediction-using-spectral-images-
This project develops a non-invasive blood group detection method using spectrum imaging, eliminating the need for traditional blood collection. By analyzing light interactions with tissues like fingertips or earlobes, it identifies blood groups based on the spectral signatures of different blood molecules
